    <!--             <h2>About ALS</h2>
                Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects nerve cells in the brain and the spinal cord. Motor neurons reach from the brain to the spinal cord and from the spinal cord to the muscles throughout the body. The progressive degeneration of the motor neurons in ALS eventually leads to their death. When the motor neurons die, the ability of the brain to initiate and control muscle movement is lost. With voluntary muscle action progressively affected, patients in the later stages of the disease may become totally paralyzed.

                <h2>The ALS Association</h2>
                All proceeds will be donated to the ALS Association, a national non-profit organization leading "the way in research, care services, public education, and public policy â€” giving help and hope to those facing the disease". (link to website)
