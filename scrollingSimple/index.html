                            <h2>About ALS</h2>
                            Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects nerve cells in the brain and the spinal cord. Motor neurons reach from the brain to the spinal cord and from the spinal cord to the muscles throughout the body. The progressive degeneration of the motor neurons in ALS eventually leads to their death. When the motor neurons die, the ability of the brain to initiate and control muscle movement is lost. With voluntary muscle action progressively affected, patients in the later stages of the disease may become totally paralyzed.

                            <h2>The ALS Association</h2>
                            All proceeds will be donated to the ALS Association, a national non-profit organization leading "the way in research, care services, public education, and public policy â€” giving help and hope to those facing the disease". (link to website)

                            <h3>Nick Ladas</h3>
                            I'm currently a Junior studying Mechanical Engineering at the University of Wisconsin Madison. I've been playing ultimate competitively since 8th grade and am currently playing on the Wisconsin Hodags. During my sophomore year in high school, my father was diagnosed with ALS, completely changing my life. This tournament has given me the chance to help everyone affected by the disease and to bring the community closer togather through a day of fun-filled competition.

                            <h3>Daniel Rasmuson</h3>
                            "If you are not making someone's life better you are wasting your time." Will Smith I am not wasting my time. My goals are to add value to the lives of people around the world. As a Management major I hope to advance the the world by pushing the boundaries of technology. Currently I am working towards this goal by improving myself in the areas of leadership and software development.
